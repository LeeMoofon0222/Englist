# Englist
<h2>Concept</h2>
Our goal is to enable users to effortlessly collect words they want to remember into their notes anytime, anywhere. Whether it's waiting for the bus, during lunch break, or leisure time at home, learning can take place. Furthermore, through a LINE Bot, customized newsletters created by ChatGPT are sent to users, providing the most suitable review content based on their learning status and progress. This allows users to effectively reinforce what they have learned in a relaxed environment.
<h2>Creation Inception</h2>
The author often encounters unfamiliar words while reading English articles and wishes to record them. However, there is a lack of applications on the market that can quickly collect words and facilitate effective review. Therefore, based on this need, the author created this product.
<h2>Feature Description</h2>
Save words anytime, anywhere:
Allows users to instantly translate and add words to their vocabulary while reading any web page.
Optimize reviews:
Use ChatGPT to tailor sentences for users to review from their vocabulary and send them via LINE Bot.
